# Data-Mining

As part of my MSc in Advanced Computing, in my Data Mining module I completed coursework comprising of the folllowing tasks:

1) Building a decision tree and using it to classify instances
2) Cluster analysis using kmeans and agglomerative hierarchal clustering
3) Text mining: computing sentiment, tokenization, fitting a multinomial naive bayes classifier.
